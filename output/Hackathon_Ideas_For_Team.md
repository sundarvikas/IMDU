# Hackathon Idea Proposals (Domain-wise)

## Healthcare

Problem Statement:
Millions lack access to quality healthcare in rural or underserved areas. Mental health support is
often overlooked, and public awareness is low.

Proposed Solution:
Develop a mobile + web platform for remote consultations with doctors, mental health support,
health tracking, and Al-powered symptom checker in regional languages. Include awareness
campaigns via gamified health tips.

## Education

Problem Statement:
Many students in remote areas face challenges accessing affordable, high-quality education.
Inequality persists in learning tools, digital resources, and individual attention.

Proposed Solution:
Create a digital learning platform with adaptive learning paths, Al tutors, regional content access,
doubt-solving bots, and career guidance tools. Focus on low-bandwidth usage and mobile-first
design.

## Fintech

Problem Statement:
Financial illiteracy, lack of secure digital payments, and difficulty in accessing credit still affect large
populations, especially in Tier 2/3 cities.

Proposed Solution:
Develop a UPI-integrated app for budgeting, goal saving, real-time fraud detection alerts, gamified
financial literacy content, and vernacular language support.

## Sustainability

Problem Statement:
People are unaware or disengaged from sustainable practices. Waste management, water
conservation, and carbon tracking are neglected.

Proposed Solution:
Design a platform that rewards eco-friendly habits. Allow waste collection requests, track household
carbon emissions, suggest improvements, and integrate smart device data for real-time feedback.
